This page was created to show an assortment of products and let users "vote" on the ones they like.
Three images are randomly generated and a user will click on one.
Then 3 more images will be randomly generated, making sure none of the previous 3 images will be shown back-to-back.
This entire process consists of 25 "rounds" of images.
After the 25th round, a chart will render showing the number of times each image was shown, and the number of times each was clicked.
Local storage is used to compile all the clicks and views by the user over time.
